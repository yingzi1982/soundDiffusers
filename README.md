# soundDiffusers

This repo estimates the scattering polar responses and diffusion coefficients of the different diffusers, following the measurement deployment and procedures recommended by AES-4id-2001.

The 2D full waveform simulation is based on the spectral element method performed on the HPC cluster named Fionn@ICHEC. Refer https://github.com/geodynamics/specfem2d for the information about the mesher and the solver.

The pre-processing and post-processing are mainly based on Bash and Octave scripts and data are visualized with GMT.
